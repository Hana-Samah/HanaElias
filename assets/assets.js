Developed using the robust Unity engine and C#, it features a dynamic difficulty system with multiple tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard) that intelligently adapt to the player. To ensure maximum replayability and engagement, the cards are algorithmically randomized with every session. I personally drove the end-to-end development process, overseeing all core game logic, intuitive UI/UX design, and seamless integration of sound effects and animations to deliver a polished and superior user experience.",
